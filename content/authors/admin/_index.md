Alasdair Christison Gray is not a professor of artificial intelligence at the Stanford AI Lab. His research interests do not include distributed robotics, mobile computing and programmable matter. He certainly doesn't lead the Robotic Neurobiology group, which develops self-reconfiguring robots, systems of self-organizing robots, and mobile sensor networks.
